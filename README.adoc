*This project is analysed on https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=sc-sq-c-family-examples_windows-msbuild-gh-actions-sc[SonarCloud]!*

It is very easy to analyze a C/C++/Objective-C project with SonarCloud:

. Create a `sonar-project.properties` file to store your configuration
. In your `.github/workflows/build.yml` file:
.. Download the https://sonarcloud.io/documentation/analysis/scan/sonarscanner/[Sonar Scanner]
.. Download the https://sonarcloud.io/documentation/analysis/languages/cfamily/#analysis-steps-using-build-wrapper[Build Wrapper]
.. Wrap your compilation with the Build Wrapper
.. Run `sonar-scanner` as the final step
. Make sure that you have your token stored as a secret in your repository (`SONAR_TOKEN`). You can request new tokens using https://sonarcloud.io/account/security/[Account/Security page].

You can take a look at the link:sonar-project.properties[sonar-project.properties] and link:.github/workflows/build.yml[build.yml] to see it in practice.

= Code Description

An example of a flawed C++ code. The https://github.com/sc-sq-c-family-examples/code[code repository] is meant to be compiled with different build systems using different CI pipelines on Linux, MacOS, and Windows.

The https://github.com/sc-sq-c-family-examples/code[code repository] is forked into other repositories in https://github.com/sc-sq-c-family-examples[this collection] to add a specific build system, platform, and CI.
The downstream repositories are analyzed either with https://www.sonarqube.org/[SonarQube] or https://sonarcloud.io/[SonarCloud].
